Question 8 — Python: Find and Fix the Bug  [Short Answer — Write Code]

The function below is SUPPOSED to count how many even numbers are in a list.
It runs without crashing, but it returns the wrong answer.

    def count_evens(numbers):
        count = 0
        for n in numbers:
            if n % 2 == 1:      # <-- something here is wrong
                count = count + 1
        return count

    # Expected: 4  (the evens are 2, 4, 6, 8)
    print(count_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]))
